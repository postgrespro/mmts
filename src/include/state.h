/*
 * Generation is a uniquely numbered subset of configured nodes allowed to
 * commit transactions. Each xact is stamped with generation it belongs
 * to. Transaction must be PREPAREd on *all* generation members before commit;
 * this provides recovery -> normal work transition without risk of reordering
 * xacts.
 *
 * The two main properties of generations are
 *   - At each node all prepares of generation n who might ever be committed
 *     lie strictly before all such prepares of generation n+1.
 *   - Node which is MTM_GEN_ONLINE in generation n holds all committable
 *     xacts of all generations < n.
 * See generations2.md and MtmGenerations.tla for details.
 *
 * Normal (making xacts) generation contains at least majority
 * members. However, we allow to elect generation with less members as a sort
 * of mark that its members are recovered enough to be included in the
 * following normal generations. It allows nodes always add *only myself* (but
 * remove anyone else) when campaigning for new generations; thus only node
 * itself decides when it is recovered enough to force others wait for it,
 * which simplifies reasoning who should be next gen members.
 *
 * Another reason for minority gens existence is usage of generations to
 * directly abort transactions when we know they can't ever be prepared; this
 * allows to participate in normal transaction resolution iff node has
 * PREPARE. For that to work, we must be sure live connectivity clique forming
 * majority eventually forms its generation regardless of recovery process.
 * c.f. handle_1a for details.
